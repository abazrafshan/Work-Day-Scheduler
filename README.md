# Work-Day-Scheduler
 
## Repository 
This repository generates a work day scheduler application. This repo is available to the public.

## Description
The demand for productivity applications continues to increase, and this application serves to satisfy some of this demand with a simple interface that allows users to set and track their work day. 

The user is presented with 9 time blocks for each hour between the time range of 9AM - 5PM. The user can type an event for each time block and save the value. These values will be stored in the time blocks even after the page refreshes. 

Building this project was an excellent exercise in jQuery, scope, and localStorage.

## Credits
This program was created with debugging feedback from fellow bootcampers.
